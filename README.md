# Innopolis schedule telegram bot

[@InnoSchedule_bot](https://t.me/InnoSchedule_bot)


This telegram bot is written for Innopolis bachelor and master students

It allows you to get:
- current and next lessons
- schedule for any weekday
- full student`s schedule table
- your friend`s current and next lessons
- reminders about next lesson

# How it works?

- python3.6
- [PyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) for interaction with telegram api
- [schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) module for sending reminders in time
- gunicorn, PySocks, requests and urllib3 for proxy work
- sqlite3 for database 

# Database structure:

### users:

**column:** | telegram_id | telegram_alias | course | course_group | english_group | need_reminders
-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
**type:** | INTEGER | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT | INTEGER

### common_lessons:

**column:** | course | day | subject | type | teacher | teacher_gender | start | end | room
-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
**type:** | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | TEXT | INTEGER

### group_lessons:

**column:** | course | day | subject | type | teacher | teacher_gender | start | end | room | lesson_group
-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
**type:** | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT | TEXT | INTEGER | TEXT


Courses and groups are saved as TEXT, because it's easier to differ or modify them. Also masters have string group names (RO, DS)

Type could be:
- 0 for Lecture
- 1 for Tutorial
- 2 for Lab
- 3 for empty (masters have no division for lectures, tutorials and labs)

Teacher gender:
- 0 for female
- 1 for male

Start and end time is saved in "%H:%M" format (e.g. 09:00)

All groups in group_lessons except course groups (e.g. English) should have some prefix (e.g. 'EN') to differ them from course groups

Days are iterated from 0, because that is how datetime.datetime works

Different threads should use different sqlite connection. Therefore, a new connection is created each time request is executed.

# Main architecture

All telegram interaction is inside main InnoSchedule.py

Database work is separated in lesson_controller and user_controller

Reminder is simple module, which is just waiting in background until it is time to send reminders
